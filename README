README (RInhibit)

    RInhibit is a simplified Rust port of the Inhibit project which is used to
    prevent the accidental execution of critical commands (e.g. to shutdown or
    reboot the system). For details see:

        https://github.com/urbanware-org/inhibit

    Other than Inhibit, this port only provides its base functionality without
    any customization options (such as custom header or colors) via config
    file. So, there is just the hostname to confirm the command execution (no
    random strings) and there also is no functionality to prevent the control
    of services via 'systemctl' the way Inhibit has.

    This repository does not include binaries. So, in order to use RInhibit,
    you have to compile it using 'cargo'. RInhibit has only one dependency
    which can be installed as follows:

        cargo add hostname

    Then use the following commands to compile:

        cargo build
        cargo run       (can be used alternatively to compile and run)

    This will create the sub-directories 'target/debug' where latter contains
    the 'rinhibit' binary, which should also be executable. If not (for
    whatever reason) you can set the executable flag as follows:

        chmod +x rinhibit

    The project was written on Linux and should run on any Unix-like system
    (without any warranty).

    RInhibit is and was not intended to be or become an actual alternative to
    Inhibit. It is just a simple a port to the Rust programming language for
    experimental as well as (more or less) educational purposes.
